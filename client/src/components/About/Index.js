          At first, I focused on becoming an architectural engineer. The idea of
          being able to develop and construct something that will someday be
          made, used, and inhabited is exciting and inspires me to pursue such a
          career. It was until I was first introduced to programming by a friend
          who was pursuing a career in software development back in 2018. After
          writing my first few lines and eventually getting my code to run
          successfully after numerous tries, I finally saw the output of what I
          have built. This sheer excitement I felt after discovering a new
          element of creativity made me, later on, focus towards building my
          skill set for programming ever since.
