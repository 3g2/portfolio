    //       At first, I focused on becoming an architectural engineer. The idea of
    //       being able to develop and construct something that will someday be
    //       made, used, and inhabited was exciting and inspired me to pursue such

    //       eventually getting it to run successfully after some tries, I finally

    //       towards building my skill set for programming ever since.
